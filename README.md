Dear MatchMellow,

I just purchased the domain matchmellow.com for my upcoming dating app. I also want to use matchmellow as my github organization, but since your name is already matchmellow, I cannot do so. If you don't mind, I would deeply deeply appreciate it, if you simply changed your username to something else. You don't have to do it of course, but if you don't mind, you would save me a lot of trouble.

Thank you in advance

Yours truly
supermuesli
